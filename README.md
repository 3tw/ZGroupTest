# ZGroupTest
ZGroup take-home assignment

For the most part, I followed the design patterns that were given to me in a Adobe XD file.  
There were some occasions, however, when I decided to change the initial design: 
a) Gotham-medium.oft seemed a bit off on browsers - I replaced it with Gotham-light.oft; 
b) I got rid of the hamburger menu on desktop screens - its role wasn't obvious to me, since another button performed the same task; 
c) I removed the inidicator of active menu link in default mode - it felt more intuitive to show the indicator only when a link is activated.

The biggest challenge was to transform the structure and logic of mobile menu to desktop menu, without unnecessary repetitions. There is still a lot of room for improvement. Main.js file would definetely benefit from refactoring.
